Come together and discuss this topic with us at Ringlers Pub on Friday the 2nd of August. We want to know your experience. We want to learn from each other and build our community of practice. We want a chance to discover what we have not seen or gain a new perspective. You can find us in the back under the Crystal Ballroom, ask for the Agile PDX group and you will find us over yummy food and drinks. Events are made possible by the AgilePDX community and our sponsors, including platinum sponsor ProFocus Technology (https://www.profocustechnology.com/).

    'title': 'Six Sigma Primer Workshop',
    'description': 'NOTE: Proceeds from ticket sales for this workshop go to Lean Portland in support of our volunteer efforts with nonprofits. Whether you work for a manufacturing company, work in an office, or provide customer service, Six Sigma can help you solve important and challenging problems within your organization, using a structured approach and data analysis. In this Six Sigma primer we‚Äôll address: - How the DMAIC model and analysis tools increase the chance of solving problems - The different Six Sigma belt certification levels (Yellow, Green, Black and Master Black Belt) - Popular analysis tools such as graphical tools, designed experiments (DOE), measurement studies, statistical process control, regression analysis and statistical software - How Six Sigma compares to Lean - Examples of Six Sigma applied to sustainability (environmental and social) - Exercises for measuring time and conducting experiments Join Brion Hurley from Business Performance Improvement to better understand how Six Sigma can be integrated into your organization. Roots of Six Sigma In 1986, engineers Bill Smith & Mikel J Harry introduced Six Sigma within Motorola, as a way to improve business performance, and make it easier for employees to utilize effective quality improvement tools. Why did Motorola come up with this program? It all began in the late 1970s, when a Japanese firm took over a Motorola factory that manufactured television sets in the United States. The Japanese promptly set about making drastic changes to the way the factory operated by reducing the variation from product to product. The factory was soon producing TV sets with 1/20th the number of defects they had produced under Motorola management, and this translated to fewer warranty claims and customer complaints. Six Sigma refers to the ability of processes to produce a very high proportion of output within specification (without defects or errors). Processes that operate with "six sigma quality" over the short term are assumed to produce long-term defect levels below 3.4 defects per million opportunities. After Motorola achieved tremendous quality improvements, the popularity spread to other companies. Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric (GE) made it integral to his business strategy in 1995, requiring his managers to achieve Green Belt certification if they wanted to get promoted. By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality. Today, Six Sigma continues to be practiced and implemented within many manufacturing, banking, healthcare, service and financial organizations.

He volunteers his time with nonprofits to teach and coach Lean concepts through an organization called Lean Portland. He is the author of the book, "Lean Six Sigma for Good."',

    'title': 'Portland OWASP: Using Graph Theory to Understand Security with Tim Morgan',
    'description': 'Using Graph Theory to Understand Security Information security is hard. It must be, because we keep getting hacked. One aspect that makes it so difficult is the level of complexity that exists in even a modestly-sized digital infrastructure. Humans can consider only so many security relationships, trust boundaries, and attack scenarios at once. This complexity makes it hard to decide where to focus our defensive resources and we\'re regularly led astray by the latest shiny tool or security advisory. Remarkably, our adversaries actually have a similar challenge: once a digital intruder gains a foothold in an environment that is completely new to them, how do they know what next steps they should take to efficiently achieve their goal? The environments they attack are not only complex, they are also unexplored landscapes that must be mapped out. This is where graph theory can lend a hand. Several open source tools, such as BloodHound and Infection Monkey, provide intruders (whether that be your friendly neighborhood pentester or your adversaries) with easy ways to map out infrastructures and identify the quickest path to your crown jewels. While this is certainly alarming, we can also use these tools ourselves to find out what our infrastructures look like in the eyes of an attacker. In this talk, Tim will provide a brief introduction to graph theory, show some demos of the free tools that use it, and discuss how he is using these techniques to build automated threat models "at scale" to make defenders\' lives easier. Speaker: Timothy Morgan After earning his computer science degrees (B.S., Harvey Mudd College and M.S., Northeastern University) and spending a short time as a software developer, Tim began his career in application security and vulnerability research. In his work as a consultant over the past 14 years, Tim has led projects as varied as application pentests, incident response, digital forensics, secure software development training, phishing exercises, and breach simulations. Tim has also presented his independent research on Windows registry forensics, XML external entities attacks, web application timing attacks, and practical application cryptanalysis at conferences such as DFRWS, OWASP\'s AppSec USA, BSidesPDX, and BlackHat USA. For the past three years Tim has been building an innovative new risk-based vulnerability management product (DeepSurface) that helps his customers gain a much deeper understanding of the complex relationships present in their digital infrastructures.

    'description': 'Abstract: My talk will present a distributed secure architecture for ‚Äúcellularization,‚Äù a process in which utilities of the players are aligned by credible/non-credible threats. The proposed solution relies on a novel decentralized permissionless cyber-physical architecture that enables players to participate in Information-Asymmetric (Signaling) games, where deception is tamed by costly signaling, formal verification and zero-knowledge cryptography. The signaling, in order to remain honest (e.g., separating), may also involve asymmetric cryptography, crypto-tokens and distributed ledgers. Here, we will present a rough sketch of the architecture and the protocols it involves. Mathematical and computational analyses will appear in a companion paper. Speaker: Professor Bud Mishra, Courant Institute Bio: Professor Bud Mishra: An educator, an inventor as well as a mentor to technologists, entrepreneurs and scientists.

In the tech industry, companies often tout all the ‚Äúfun‚Äù benefits they offer to employees, but do those perks really matter to everyone?

    'description': 'Registration link coming soon. Funding continues to lag for women entrepreneurs in Biotechnology.¬† As the largest women-owned intellectual property IP firm in the US, McCoy Russell LLP has been closely watching the participation of women as inventors.¬† The ability to protect innovation through patents is a key driver to obtaining funding, and statistics show that a significant gender gap still exists in both funding and inventorship even though the biotechnology industry has increased the number of women scientists. The average women inventorship rate in the US is approximately 13% with Oregon ranking in the bottom one-third of US states. In the last decade, only 20% of inventors on patents assigned to universities and hospitals and only 15% of inventors on patents granted to public research organizations were women.¬† In addition, even when these applications are filed, data shows that USPTO examiners treat women inventors more harshly. A Yale study shows that women inventors had an 8.2% lower chance of obtaining a US patent where the names were clearly indicative of gender.¬† While funding opportunities also remain scarce (45% less funding per Boston Consulting Group), investors supporting women entrepreneurs have found a higher average ROI (10% higher). It is in this light that McCoy Russell has developed approaches to support organizations in enhancing women participation at all levels, including in brainstorming, invention submission, etc.¬† Because diversity leads to increased innovation, organizations can received significant valuation benefits in their portfolios.',

    'title': 'PLUG Linux Clinic',
    'description': 'The Linux Clinic meets once a month on the third Sunday from 1 - 5 pm at Free Geek, 1731 SE 10th Avenue, Portland, 97214. Bring your Linux computer that is being a brat and we\'ll teach it some manners. Or bring your computer that has some evil operating system on it and we\'ll send it home with a shiny, clean Linux distro. Or just come and look over shoulders to see what Linux is all about. If you already know Linux well, the Clinic is also a good place to learn how to help users troubleshoot problems. It\'s excellent training for tech support work in Linux. We have monitors, mice, keyboards, and miscellanous other perifpherals, so generally all you need to bring is the box. There will also be coffee and people usually bring munchies as well. After all, you can\'t do computers on an empty tummy.',
